## Thoughts on Divjoy

I’ve been through the experience of creating all the boilerplate needed to get a react-app off the ground a few times, it’s not fun. So when I came across divjoy it made total sense to me.

Choosing your third-party providers and then having a neatly structured codebase to download saves days of development time. What’s also super nice is the patterns that are established, all nice modern syntax using hooks where applicable.

I have a voice in the back of my head that says setting up all the boilerplate with my own patterns is a good foundational knowledge for me to have about my app. I know generally how the template works, but it’s never going to match the level of granular detail you have when you set up the code base file-by-file.

**Will it be like staying in someone else's house, where I don’t feel comfortable making a mess?**
