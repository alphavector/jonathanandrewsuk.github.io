## Sass idea? Close the text-editor for a second

It’s something you may not want to hear depending on your level of technical ability, testing out your unique idea by completely depending on someone else’s tools isn’t futureproof. The only issue with thinking about future proofing at this point is that 

> your new idea is NOT GOING TO WORK in its current form anyway.

Free yourself from the fear that by building V1 using existing tools that you will need to rebuild everything... because you are going to rebuild everything anyway. 

This is something I’ve learned from countless hours on products that never made it to production. It’s true that the process of building these has led to rewards in other parts of my life, but it would be nice to have a more accurate mindset whilst plugging away through the prototype roadmap.

One caveat I would make is the need for modularity, if a dependency is weaved through multiple places in your product it’s going to cloud any product decisions related to changing or removing it. The problem is that very often it’s the quickest gains are made by taking dependencies to the core of your app, use the storage/cloud functions/auth and front end framework from AWS or Firebase and you’ll be feeling great at first then trapped later.
